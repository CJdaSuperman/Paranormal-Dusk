# Paranormal-Dusk
This is the fourth tech demo I’ve made with Unity Engine.

It's a first-person shooter horror game where your goal is to survive hordes of monsters while discovering what your connection to them is. Explore and find ammo pickups for guns such as pistols, shotguns, SMGs and snipers. You have to be quick though, your flashlight fades over time and the only way to replenish the flashlight’s brightness is by also picking up batteries around the environment.

I learned how to make this game through Udemy's Complete C# Unity Developer 3D course. Most of the assets were from Unity’s Asset Store. Most of the code to make the gameplay elements are also from the course. However, I incorporated more features than what the course offered and that code I made myself. These features include a HUD that you can toggle on and it fades away, replenish player health from killing the monsters that did damage to you, and creating ammo boxes to get ammo.

To find the source code for this project, go to Assets-> Scripts (disregard the folder named ‘Script’).
